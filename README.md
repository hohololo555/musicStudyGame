Need to study some MP3 files so you can help yourself recognize them?

Want to learn to recognize some of your favorite songs with only
the first second of its music?

musicStudyGame is exactly what you're looking for! 

Just specify a directory of mp3 files, how many seconds of the song you'd like to hear, and how many rounds you'd like to do and let musicStudyGame will take the rest off your hands, playing exactly that many seconds of a random song from your directory and then prompting you for its title (assuming its in the name of the MP3)

	Usage: python music.py <path to folder of MP3 files> <duration to play songs (in seconds)> <number of rounds>
 
	pip install -r requirements.txt
to automatically download the one required package

just a simple little tool I made for my music class, enjoy!
